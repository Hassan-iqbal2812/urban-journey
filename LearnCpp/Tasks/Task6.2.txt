[NOTES] :

[TASK] : Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, one named smaller,
the other named larger. If the user enters a smaller value for the second
integer, use a block and a temporary variable to swap the smaller and larger
values. Then print the values of the smaller and larger variables. Add
comments to your code indicating where each variable dies. Note: When you
print the values, smaller should hold the smaller input and larger the larger
input, no matter which order they were entered in.
