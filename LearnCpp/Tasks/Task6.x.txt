[NOTES] : 

[TASK] : Q1
Fix the following program
include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Enter a positive number: ";
	int num{};
	std::cin >> num;


	if (num < 0)
		std::cout << "Negative number entered.  Making positive.\n";
		num = -num;

	std::cout << "You entered: " << num;

	return 0;
}
[TASK] : Q2
Write a file named constants.h that makes the following program run. If your compiler is C++17 capable, use inline constexpr variables. Otherwise, use normal constexpr variables. max_class_size should be 35.
main.cpp:

#include <iostream>
#include "constants.h"

int main()
{
	std::cout << "How many students are in your class? ";
	int students{};
	std::cin >> students;


	if (students > constants::max_class_size)
		std::cout << "There are too many students in this class";
	else
		std::cout << "This class isn't too large";

	return 0;
}
[TASK] : Q3
Complete the following program by writing the passOrFail() function, which should return true for the first 3 calls, and false thereafter. Do this without modifying the main() function.

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "User #1: " << (passOrFail() ? "Pass\n" : "Fail\n");
	std::cout << "User #2: " << (passOrFail() ? "Pass\n" : "Fail\n");
	std::cout << "User #3: " << (passOrFail() ? "Pass\n" : "Fail\n");
	std::cout << "User #4: " << (passOrFail() ? "Pass\n" : "Fail\n");
	std::cout << "User #5: " << (passOrFail() ? "Pass\n" : "Fail\n");

	return 0;
}

The program should produce the following output:
User #1: Pass
User #2: Pass
User #3: Pass
User #4: Fail
User #5: Fail

[COMPLETED] : TRUE
